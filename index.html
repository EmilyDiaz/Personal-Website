            <h1> Hi, I'm Emily!</h1>
            <p>
                I'm a <strong>UX Designer</strong> focusing on interactions and an experience that tells a story, as well as helps the client meet their needs.
            </p>
            <p>
                My previous work experiences in the science field also grants me the ability to research and tackle user problems from a different perspective: UX
                Design is a <strong>scientific</strong> process as much as it is also a <strong>design</strong> process.
